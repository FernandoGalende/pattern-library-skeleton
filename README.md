## :fire: Overview

We use of the best tools to improve the workflow to allow you to create an awesome library of components!

- [ReactJs](https://facebook.github.io/react/) v16
- Type checking with [PropTypes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types)
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) for styling components and application
- Compiled of modern JavaScript with [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel) and bundle with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Testing library](https://testing-library.com/) for unit/ui testing
- Automate Git hooks with [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)
- Code linting using [Eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint)
- Code formatter using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- Developing isolated UI components with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)

## :rocket: Getting Started

To get you started, you need to meet the prerequisites, and then follow the installation instructions.

#### Figma design tokens example

**Figma file:** [https://www.figma.com/file/IGr2xoqcZX91CU7CDr4ZsI](https://www.figma.com/file/IGr2xoqcZX91CU7CDr4ZsI)

For more info to config your design tokens file, visit ["How to configure design tokens with Figma API"](https://pattern-library-skeleton.netlify.com/?path=/docs/overview-intro--page)

#### Installing

You can clone our Git repository:
`$ git clone git@github.com:klaufel/pattern-library-skeleton.git`

#### Wiring up your development environment

Setting up, is as easy as running:

`$ npm run install`

This command will install all the required dependencies. Please note that `npm install` is only required on your first start, or in case of updated dependencies.

#### Initializing Storybook

`$ npm run storybook`

#### Generate design tokens as variables

`$ npm run tokens`

## :triangular_ruler: Architecture

Based on [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) principles, methodology for creating design systems. There are five distinct levels of components:

- Atomic Design component structure:
  - Atoms
  - Molecules
  - Organism
  - Templates
  - Pages

When we use the library, the maximum level of component that we are going to have would be an `organism`, the rest of the `templates`and `pages` components are built in the application that imports the library.

##### Source project structure:

```
â””â”€â”€ src
    â”œâ”€â”€ components
    â”‚	â”œâ”€â”€ atoms
    â”‚	â”œâ”€â”€ molecules
    â”‚ â””â”€â”€ pages
    â”œâ”€â”€ docs
    â”œâ”€â”€ figma-tokens
    â”œâ”€â”€ styles
    â””â”€â”€ index.js (entry point)
```

- `src`: The place where to put our application source code - `components` Add your components here! This folder is divided from [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) principles.
- `docs` Add documentation as stories for design system.
- `figma-tokens` Folder all functions to generate figma design tokens with API.
- `styles` Folder to add global styles and theme to build components.
- `index.js` Entry point, import all components and export to generate package to use in project as a dependency.

---

##### Example of `component` structure

```
â””â”€â”€ MyComponent
    â”œâ”€â”€ __stories__
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ MyComponent.stories.{js|mdx}
    â”œâ”€â”€ __tests__
    â”‚	â”œâ”€â”€ __snapshots__
    â”‚	â”‚   â””â”€â”€ MyComponent.test.js.snap
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ MyComponent.test.js
    â”œâ”€â”€ MyComponent.styles.js
    â””â”€â”€ index.js
```

- **mycomponent**: Folder which contains our component.
  - `__stories__`: Folder to contains the stories for Storybook.
    - `MyComponent.stories.js`: Contains the stories of component for Storybook
  - `__tests__`: Folder to contains the tests of component.
    - `__snapshots__`: Folder to contains the snapthots tests, autogenerated for jest.
      - `MyComponent.test.js.snap`: Snapshot file, autogenerated for jest.
    - `MyComponent.test.js`: Contains the test of component.
  - `MyComponent.styles.js`: Contain the styles of component (styled-components / CSS-in-JS).
  - `index.js`: Contains the React component, HTML or other imports from ui-library.

## :nail_care: Guidelines

###### Linting

`$ npm run lint` Find problems in your code `(js)`

###### Formatter

`$ npm run prettier:check` Find format problems in your code.

`$ npm run prettier:write` Fix format problems in your code.

## :pray: Testing the application

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/), a delightful javascript testing framework and [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) builds on top of DOM testing library by adding APIs for working with React components.

#### Running your tests

`$ npm run test` Will perform your unit testing.

`$ npm run test:update` Will perform your unit testing and update snapshots.

`$ npm run test:watch` Will perform your unit testing and watchers tests.

`$ npm run test:coverage` Will perform your unit testing and show coverage.

`$ npm run test:coverage-web` Will perform your unit testing and show coverage and open report in your default browser.
